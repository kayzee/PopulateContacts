PopulateContacts
================

PopulateContacts is a simple app that will populate the iOS Simulator Contacts app with 100 random contacts. It also provides the ability to delete all contacts (just in case you hit the Add button too many times :))

### Usage

1. Download the source.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Select the iOS Simulator version that you would like to add the contacts to in the Xcode project (default is "iPhone 6.0 Simulator"). Each version of the iOS Simulator contains different data.
4. Press the Add or Delete buttons to your heart's content.
